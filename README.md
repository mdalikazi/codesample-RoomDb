### What is this repository for? ###

* App name
    - cc-airtasker = Code Challenge - Airtasker

* Versions
    - v1.0 = No database
    - v2.0 = Room database (albeit, in-memory database)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
	- If you run into trouble with compiling gradle, try setting `versionCode = 1`

        (`def commitCount` in gradle needs git to be added to PATH)

* Database configuration
	- Currently Room database is in-memory. I need to do more research on how to access disk database safely off main thread with Executors

### Contribution guidelines ###

	- Please take a look at my git flow. I have left all the branches alive.

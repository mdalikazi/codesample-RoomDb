### What is this repository for? ###
A sample app based on coding challenge that uses Room DB.

* Versions
    - v1.0 = No database
    - v2.0 = Room database (in-memory database)
    
* Libraries used

    - Glide (https://github.com/bumptech/glide)  
    I used Glide to load and display images because it is efficient. It loads images lazily which is good for app performance.
    
    - Gson (https://github.com/google/gson)  
    The go-to library to consume or create JSON.

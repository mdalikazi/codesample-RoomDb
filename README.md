# README #

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit a code challenge app for Android position at Airtasker.

I had a lot of fun and I got to learn something new: Room.

I hope the code is easy to understand, as I try to write code that is easy to maintain long term.

I am eager to hear your honest feedback. Looking forward to getting the feedback in person. :)

### What is this repository for? ###

* App name
    - cc-airtasker = Code Challenge - Airtasker

* Versions
    - v1.0 = No database
    - v2.0 = Room database (albeit, in-memory database)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
	- If you run into trouble with compiling gradle (especially on Windows machines), try setting `versionCode = 1`

        (`def commitCount` in gradle needs git to be added to PATH)

* Database configuration
	- Currently I have used in-memory Room database. I need to do more research on how to access disk database safely off main thread with Executors

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Git flow
	- Please take a look at my git flow. I have left all the branches intact after merging.

	    My main branch is `develop`, and merge to `master` only for release to production.
